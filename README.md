Overview:
This project is a Spam Classifier that predicts whether an incoming email or SMS message is Spam or Ham (Not Spam). 
The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning classifiers to achieve high accuracy.
The dataset contains labeled SMS/email messages, and the project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification.

Features:
Preprocesses raw text using tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization.
Trains and evaluates multiple ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).
Achieves high accuracy in detecting spam vs ham messages.
Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and performance metrics.

Tech Stack:
Languages/Frameworks: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
NLP Tools: NLTK(for text preprocessing)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Dataset: SMS Spam Collection Dataset

Results:
Best performing model: [insert your top classifier, e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes]
Accuracy achieved: 86%
Precision: 50%

Future Improvements:
Use Deep Learning (LSTM / BERT) for better performance.
Deploy as a Flask/Streamlit web app for real-time classification.
Test on larger and more diverse datasets.
